Seems like I wrote a lot more on this blog but apprently this will be near two weeks since I wrote on this. Pretty weird. I thought I wrote a lot on this since. From looking at this site, looks like it has nearly been 10 days since I wrote on this site. This feels pretty shit and I need to keep writing here. I don't know why. I just know it's a good thing. 

### Studying format

For the last couple of days, I've felt paralised to program. I've thankfully kept at it with little bits of code here and there, not to forget anything. I lull in the mind swept over me, the fear of not knowing. This angered me in my mind. "I'm I stuck again?" I thought. As I write this, I can picture my fraustration. Not so much now. 

I decided on days where I don't know what to work on, it's better to put at least four pomotoros than none. I keep saying to myself "sure I could be putting more time into it" but I've been able to convince myself that 2 hours worth of good studying, is a good start for me. I'll alternate from CSS Design and React/JS per day to day, forcing me to keep my head in the mid ground. I'm thinking of doing Anki again, but that has to be a lot easier for me to deal with, so Ill be setting that for 50 cards a day rather than 100. 

I'm not much of a fan of Jordan Peterson. Some of his advise is a bit out there but his intention, I can't faulter. It's getting started which was the advise from someone else. It was Jordan which said keep going regardless how small you think it is, which is keeping myself going now. 

#### Studying better

The plan is to use for pomotoro timer per day as the minimal. That's 25 minutes each so about 2 hours worth of studying. I've noticed as I type this, there's not much happening with the guys and team so being up at around 8am and ready to study from 08:30 is a good shout. Of course with my father, this makes things harder but that comes from the struggles of life. Can't win them all. 

This feels good. If I want to do more programming, fair does but for now, this feels good. I'll do at least one Pomotoro. I have to help my father out here now. Let's see how it goes.
