Manging Viperio LoL has it's ups and downs. I've decided to take a break from managing LoL for some very simple reasons. 


* I don't play LoL that much.
* I need to see if I enjoy the game.
* I find it hard to keep up with following LoL.
* This probably has something to do with not playing LoL much. 

It was important to find out if I enjoyed playing League of Legends. We all need to have that factor of being able to carry the game and having the brains to do something for the team. Therefore I decided to start playing LoL again. It's been fun. A big problem of playing jungle for me is quite simple. I don't play the chanpions required to take advantage of the game. In a meta where it only takes to break the jungler and then play the game normally from there, seems to matter a lot. 

A good jungler might be able to get back, but after playing the role, when you get behind, you're absolutely screwed. So I started playing Shen again at top. Shocker. It's the only champion I really want to play and with Ignite, I can influence the game. I need to lookup better and more understood ways to play the game. I'll get In4 to throw me resources to help me better understand the game to take more advantage over it. As long as I'm playing the game to better understand it while making friends in the same time, that seems like a great idea. 

Right now, I need to be more consistent and understand how the enemy jungler wants to play. Watching Jonny play and see how he plays the game, will give me far better insight. Should be good craic.
