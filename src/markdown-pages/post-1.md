This is going to be my first blog post for the site. I'm not going to lie. I have been dreading trying to make this site. The fear of failure and thinking that all the time I've put into this, has been a waste of time. As I write this, I feel more confident that ever that I'm getting closer to the person I want to be. I'm not a mega programmer or anything like that, but I'm getting there and I think that's all that needed.

I'm glad that the internet is made up of loads of guides that help me get better. I know for years that I said I wanted to make a blog and see how far I could get. I've made loads of WordPress blogs and that's easy but it's not actually programming or anything like that. It's just using the work from someone and going from there. I have no idea how to use PHP. Learning JS/React/Gatsby has slowly helped me understand more about web development. I do like SEO and making sure those that want to market themselves more effectively, can be benefited from it. For now though, this is the start and I'm very happy to at least be starting something. 

I'm thankful for all the friends that have encouraged me over the years to keep going and still do to this day. I'll make mention of them in the future in a wee post so people who do stroll by this website, at least will know who they are. For me it matters. The future is looking bright and even in the days of COVID 19, we've got a vaccine which I can only hope, brings us back to some sort of normality.
