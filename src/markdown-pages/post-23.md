It's a bit of a shame. I was having fun knowing that WordPress could be used as my Headless CMS, but I'm not prepared to contunue to work with it on this site if newer versions of Gatsby make plugins, broken. 

I aim in the future when I have more knowledge to migrate the WordPress Database to Strapi. That way, I'll be able to update the posts all over again. Maybe it might take a rebuild of this website, which in all honesty might happen when I move over to NextJS. That'll all take time. 

I'm honestly not sure if GoDaddy is making it that Netlify can't access my GraphQL. I'm able to build locally but I wasn't Netlify. This annoyed me too much where it becomes a question that I have to spend a lot of money to host something I don't think I actually need to worry about. Maybe I'll learn how to host WordPress Locally. That might be the best thing to do in the future.
