One of the things which I leant early within professional esports/gaming, was that you need to take chances. If you don't take a chance, you aren't trying to find the wins which aren't logical. While logic should win all the time, we're not robots. Finding logic in the moving world isn't something that can always be waited on. 

Take a chance is what it is to be human. It is to find trust in the words and actions of others, while not having all the evidence. It's to use one's expertise and experience without the full picture to be able to answer the question. I've been given many of chances in my life and I'm not even 30 year. 

I'm about to make a call with the team I want to use for Viperio and while I've learnt to grow up getting as much information as possible, 2020 has taught us that speed is everything. Perfection is the enemy of movement. To give someone a chance is one of the most powerful motivators in the world and while it can fail, it is movement. 

As a manager, one of the most important things I can do, is give people a chance but afterwards, to monitor and experience it. I can't really explain how this works but to experience it, is to get yourself involved with the team in a capacity that you are capable of operating within at the best of knowledge. Throughout my competitive COD days, I have always been a people person, leading from experience and giving people my best advice. In League of Legends, the game is far more complex but being able to understand the pressure they operate under, I understand.

In Summer, I had the pleasure to play with some of the best Call of Duty players in the world once again. The energy of competition was amazing and it is something that you must experience to actually understand. It must be you, that is in the front seat. With League of Legends, I have been able to work in teams made by others and compete. Unfortunately at my level, I was not playing anywhere near the highest level however I did compete and it was great. SoloQ helps with that in some sense. The difference with Call of Duty is the skill element of the game. While League of Legends has it's skill, an FPS like COD RO, is all about razer reactions and position. There's not too many other games that come at this level and because of this, the ease of the game becomes complex. The pressure to make the right move and to outplay the opponents, is addictive. 

I absolutely understand what it is to be in the position of a player at the highest level and while I have not had the glory to play in-front of a stadium, I don't need it. The pressure to become the best and to perform at my best, I have achieved. I know what it is like. At the moment, sometimes you have no choice but to use all of your skill to make the impossible, possible and outplay and logic would dictate many other things, but you simply don't have the time to make it. 

As a team manager for Viperio, while there is a science to find out what is the best player, sometimes it's about finding enough about a player where you play with speed and decide it's worth taking a chance. It is expertise and experience which helps create these choices. What I have to do, is watch and learn and put myself in the shoes of these players. Afterwards, it's about making sure I am in the right place, in the right time, to make sure these players are in the best position possible with the right people. 

I'm going to be making some big choices now from gut feeling and I'm going to be giving another player a chance. I could find a better player, but I don't think I need to. Being perfect, is the enemy.
