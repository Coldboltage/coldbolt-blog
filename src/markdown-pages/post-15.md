I wasn't so bad this time was I. I gave myself quite a break this time. I worried way too much about what to do with ColdboltSEO and put myself away for a bit. That was a bit dumb. I've got some sort of an idea of what to do with ColdboltSEO. I'll write something about it tomorrow so I can get myself on the way with it. It's important as this is the project with others, that I'll be trying to get things sorted with via traveling. 

I'm fairly sure esports is the industry I want to work in. It's got the type of people I want to get to know. One of the issues I'm having is the argument to why SEO is needed for the actual industry. End of the day, if no one wants to take me up on work, it'll be hard to justify trying to run ColdboltSEO. In the same time, I kind of need to prove how good of an SEO I am. There's quite a lot I'm going to have to work on but I'm on the mend to get back on the boat. 

That being said, for ColdboltSEO, esports SEO is still under my control. Talking about what's wrong with SEO within Esports might be the way I go about it again. I want to talk about the issues and then apply the issues. If I then want to talk about how to do it properly, then I can. I like to complain about things and present issues. Maybe that's the way I'll go about it. The old way.
