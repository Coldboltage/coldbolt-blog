I get I shouldn't fear trying out new things but god it certainly puts fear into me trying to figure this out. Anxiety I guess? I'm honestly not sure but I keep thinking the worse whenever I'm coding. Will I be able to do this? Will I fail? Should I already know how to do this? I've seen this before, why can't I remember it? I'm sure a better person than myself would be able to progress a lot faster but it's hard to accept that I'm not as fast as those people. It's the smarter thing to do. Accept who you are and be gone with it! I guess I'm going to have to start accepting that I'm slower and I have to take some shortcuts to get things done. Maybe I won't know as much as I want about these sites but in the end of the day, if I can at least get the job done, that's all that's needed. 

I don't want to settle for that though. I want to keep challenging myself to be as smart as possible whenever it comes to programming. In the end of the day, when I think I have to write something in Javascript, I'm honestly in the thinking that I'm not ready for it. To be fair though, I haven't looked at databasing and I really have to get a grip on that. I wanted to use Meteor.js for that but I need to move on with that or else I'll be thinking "what if", constantly. These are the thoughts I have whenever I'm looking to add images to the site. Sad but reality. 

In the end of the day, I know I'm probably going to be able to do this and it's only by actually doing these small blog posts and actually getting the job done, is it possible for me to do it. I think everything is a lot harder than it should be but by doing the work I'm doing now, I'm honestly learning. I guess my fraustation comes from not being able to absorb the information as well as others, and that it takes far longer for me to actually understand something. I know I have to read something first and get the theroy but from that, it really should be a lot easier for me to understand what I'm wanting to do, but rather I still have to go through tutorials and slowly get the feel of it. 

This is probably where my anxiety stems from. End of the day though, I have to accept that I am a different person. A unique one where I have other strengths and maybe those are the things that qualify me as a talented person in other areas. I must understand that while learning and getting there seems hard, I do eventually get to where I need and so in this post, I'll figure a way to add images to the size I want. How I'll do this, I have a vague idea. I'll start from there.
