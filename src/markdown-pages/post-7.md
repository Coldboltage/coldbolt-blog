I'm excited for Wednesday. The thought of programming or learning to do it. Writing this, I know I'm not actually programming but I feel like I'm getting more involved as a programmer. I know SEO is going to be something that I need to know but being able to write on VSC and talk about the things of the day on something I made, it's very liberating. 

I certainly need to get better with reading normal javascript and being able to understand how websites are operating a lot faster. Gatsby allows me to get away with a lot of things which I'm going to accept. I generally just want to be able to make well optimized sites and I'm not too interested in going into the technicalities of things. Like overclocking a computer, I like to make the biggest gains within the least amount of time and Gatsby allows me to do it. Next.js catches my eye and it's a little more complicated which I hope will allow for a more comprehensive understanding of web development and javascript. 

Thinking about it now, I looked at Petter [Kaspersen's rosternews.info](https://rosternews.info) site and I'm now able to understand how the site was made. It's nothing great or amazing but it does the job. The thing is though, I understand how he was able to male the site. That's fairly cool
