I loved managing. I loved making sure my players were put in what I believed, was the best position and make sure, they could win. The last month has been tiring and I think the time has come for me to recognise, that I'm not the manager I once was. Even when I look at 2019, I was a lot more active, making sure my players were in the best position possible. Now, I just can't be that same person. 

I watch League of Legends, World 2021 with no where near the same excitement. I watch it as something to be on the second screen and that's not what a manager should be. A manager should be someone that wishes they could be in the position to game. I do wish I could game more, but the operations of life, do not permit me to be in that position right now. This site needs the love and care and I need to be sorting out myself out. In the same time, my father takes up a lot of time and I have to accept that also. 

If I'm to get back to managing, I need to be playing a lot more League of Legends again. I need to be putting in lots of time into that but with the way the game is going, it's in a hard place to enjoy. That's the problem. I don't think I enjoy the game enough that I wish to be managing but rather, someone that can watch it from the sidelines. I think that makes far more sense. 

### Programming, that's the priority

Programming is going to be the thing which I push a lot of time into. In the same time, I need to find a project that I actually want to put time into. This has been something that has slowed me down a lot. I can't think of something that I actually want to do and that's annoying. When I can think of something, then it'll become easier. One of the things I've noticed, is while I might not be able to program well now, CSS is something I have interest with. Not the crazy CSS stuff, but the stuff that let's me make websites seem a little more interesting. 

I'll be looking to design websites via following a lot of tutorials for now. Ones that take 1-2 hours. Keeping that at least once a day so I keep always on the ball. To make CSS very obvious. I like the idea of tailwind, but there's far more which I want to get sorted. I want to know how to do way more things than what tailwind is "meant" to help me out with. It's too trivial to say that's the solution. I have a plan in some capacity which I'll move on. One thing I do want to do. I want to play League again and by managing, I just don't have that time. We'll see.
