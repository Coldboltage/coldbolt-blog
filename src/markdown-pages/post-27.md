I don't do well in updaing this but it's better than nothing. I'm currently in hospital waiting to see if my dad is going to be better. Currently in the hospital with him. We called up the cancer emergency number "probably the wrong way to write this" to talk about his bladder issue. Turns out it could be an infection. While this might slow down his chemo, it's certainly the right thing to make sure he gets the right treatment to take care of what could be an infection. 

I write this now on my laptop which I really should be doing work. I should be at the point to figure out what I want to do but the stress keeps me paralsyed. I think a lot of it has to do with the managing also and I think I'm going to have to give this up. As much as I love trying to help players go further and further, I believe I am not aiming to do this at the professional level and it's not something I am willing to take a chance. Programming seems to be the right way to do things and I think it's going to be the direction that I go into for the future. Health/programming/soicial/gaming in that order. I might have to kee up to my obligations but I think it might be time to push back on some of these obligations and maybe work as the academy team-manager. This seems like the right thing. 

Having to worry about computers games, players coming on, if they want to become pro, I don't want to do that anymore. There are some players I'll do what I can but to make sure all five players aim to do this, all the time, hmm. Maybe it's the stress this week has brought around. I'll be happy to work with Jonny and bring point him to the right direction, but I don't think I can do that within Viperio or as a team manager. It feels like I want to work with specific people and work with them long-term and I feel in the position I am in, this doesn't happen.

As much as I love to work to winning and the story of it all, I am 30 and I have to achieve my dreams. My health is slowing me down and it's time to get that sorted. I will get that sorted. That's my goal.

#### I could be programming

In the end of the day, I could be programming but I feel I have to be online all the time for my players. That's the issue. I feel like I have to give a lot to managing but the issue is, I'm not willing to put everything into it and I think that's the problem. That's the issue. I just can't. I need to worry about being able to know what's going on with everything. That's why I need to be put in a position that doesn't force me to be at this high position. I ned to be doing this in a hobby position until I have the programming sorted. That's the goal. I will move to this.
