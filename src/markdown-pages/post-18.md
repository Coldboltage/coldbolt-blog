This was an interesting lab project. It was pretty difficult to find a GraphQL which works well but SpaceX did it well. It's very different to to work with than what I was used to. With posts, everything about all the posts I make, are organised. With SpaceX, I was hoping to get all the information about the mission and everything that relates to that mission but it wasn't as detailed. I was hoping the id per mission would help out but that didn't prove to be of much use. I was a bit disapointed but for now, I'm starting to get more used to the basics of the tools I'm using. 

One of the things which I had a lot to learn was working with data which I didn't have control over. While I know how to source information from things that I have control over, this was the first time sourcing data from things I didn't have control over. In this case, SpaceX. I've never had to change a GraphQL value, pointing to an image, into a Gatsby Image before. That was new. As much as I know that I'm going through a lot of plugins to get the things that I want, it's getting the results I want at the end of the day. It's good stuff I'll accept it. 

Afterwards, some of the images didn't want to work and looping through that was a lot more trouble. Thankfully I was patient and got through a lot of problems. The experience I gained was very useful and it's going to add to the things I know. I'll aim to mess around with more things tomorrow! Was a good day.
