I did a little more programming today. There's so much to ReactJS and I need a lot more time. I should hopefully get more time tomorrow as it shouldn't be as crazy. Dad had quite a lot going on with him today and it forced me once again to get up and get back into action. I don't mind that but I want to make sure that I can commit to the programming when I can. 

Should I make this repo private? I'm pretty sure I should as anyone will be able to read this if they know how to find this Github account. I don't mind if people find the website organically, that's fine. That's the point to why this website was made. Might be a bit stupid for people to read this in my third person, but the hell of it. 

I'm getting through ReactJS well but it's been a slow day. A lot of theroy and hoping I remember it all. I know with a lot of work and effort, I'll be fine. I went onto this as a means to make sure that I learn a lot of the best practises with ReactJS. I'm happy I'm doing this. I wish it was quicker but then again, more people would be doing this. 

As I type this, I'm happy that I was able to get this laptop. It was expensive but it's a great laptop. I'm able to move anywhere with it, be anywhere in the world with it. I hope to be able to do some work for people with the skills I learn. I wonder what they'll be. I actually have no idea what it'll be but if I think about it, it's probably going to have to do with building parts of a website and go from there. Hopefully it's something I like. It's kinda why I want to learn more about ethicial hacking. Do one good job and I'm fine. Then again, I'm always working for someone else which isn't great. That's what I'll aim to move away from. Working for someone else. 

It'll be easier to learn to work for myself as I gain more skills. Not too sure what that can be. Esports shop seems to be a good idea. I think most of the implimentations are pretty crap right now. I'll have to research this in the future. Infact I'll do that and then maybe combined with a bit of SEO, I can get something sorted. That's not a bad idea.
