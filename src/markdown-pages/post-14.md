I've got to be honest, I wanted to just say "that'll do" but no, I wanted to keep making it better and better. While there's still lots to do, I'm happy with what I have right now on the site. 

There's not much to talk about if I'm to be honest. The site is pretty much the same but I've at least coded everything that I can which isn't Gatsby. The site runs so much quicker and it takes far less money to take care of it. I was very scared that GoDaddy was a terrible idea but thankfully I was able to find a netlify caching plugin for Gatsby. I assume if changes are made in the future to the cache, this will need to change but for now, I'll not worry too much about it. 

From spending £25 a month to £1 a month, this is a great change and next month, I'll see the money being saved. I'm sure I'll be able to work with someone and I'm already thinking of plans to work with a player in the future. I've said for years I'd work with them and I think it's time to pay on that. 

Making sure the site is built from a strong foundation has been something I've wanted for years and I've now got it. GatsbyJS on ColdboltSEO. I've worked on this since the 5rd of April. I thought it would be easier in some sense but I thought a lot of things would be harder. That makes no sense what I'm saying but I know what I felt as I was coding. 

With ColdboltSEO now on GatsbyJS, as long as I keep the site active every month, I don't think I'll have much competition to worry about. I'm just so glad that I've been able to move from WordPress to GatsbyJS after years of knowing about it. 

I remember talking about it with Phil Collins at 2019 when I wanted to work with him with Zymplify. Unfortunately that never happened but we've got moving and well, we're cooking with gas. Woo hoo!
