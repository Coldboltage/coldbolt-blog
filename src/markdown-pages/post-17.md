Now that wasn't so hard was it Alan? Actually it was but that was because the Riot API wasn't being nice to me. CORS ended up being the problem but I didn't really know what was actually going on. Turns out Riot don't want people to be accessing the Riot API via frontend means. That was annoying.

It ended up being a lot easier after I got used to it. I'm doing things the easier way for now but I'll more than likely use Axios for the configurations which I can make. I'll need to get more used to what configs I can make but I'm happy with what I can do it with. Still a lot to learn.

I was able to learn how to the hook, useRef. The .current caught me out a bit but I've got used to that now. I'll probably make plenty of mistakes though but it's a good start to get back into the swing of things. 

I'm more than likely going to take a quick ReactJS course. While I did one a while back, I don't think it really went into my head. I was too interested to work with MeteorJS at the time. I'm not too interested with it anymore though I might give it a shot in the future as I get more used to reactjs. I loved my GatsbyJS course so I'll be using the same Udemy tutor again, John Smilga. He makes learning a lot easier so I'm looking forward to it. 

I'm electing to put about one month into learning ReactJS properly again. I'm fairly understood with GatsbyJS but after talking with James yesterday, christ there's a lot for me to learn. I've decided in three months, I want to be ready to travel. Early wakes to get practising is 100% needed again.
