Little bit of house keeping was needed with the backup site for ColdboltSEO. It dawned to me that it's pretty dumb of me to keep using the heavy theme which I bought years ago. Contentberg was great whenever I had little idea how to program. Since then, I've copied enough of the theme I wanted for ColdboltSEO. Technically speaking, the website is ready to be used anytime which is the good thing of WordPress. While I'm using it as my headless CMS, it's nice to know that if I want someone else to run the site, it's technically ready to operate at anytime.

## Moving in with my Dad

As said, I've moved in with my Dad and this will be two weeks since I moved in. The great benefit has been that it's forced me to program a lot more. I simply don't have the time to do anything else and I need to be with my Dad as much as I can. To keep myself occupied, I keep learning how to code. I'm not that bad at it but when it comes to proper coding stuff, I'm as thick as they come. That's probably something I should slowly work on. 

It's not been that bad living with my Dad. As much as I keep thinking to myself that it's annoying, it's not. Im able to get what I need done, manage my team that I'll talk about after the UKLC Promo/Relegations and get shit sorted. My Dad is certainly getting better. I remember when I had to be there with my Dad initially the first few times going to the hospital. Even about five weeks ago when they kept delaying my Dad's chemo. He's getting a lot better. 

## Development with ReactJS

I'm coming to the point that I have a good enough idea with React. About another month of pure programming per day will get me to the stage that I'm alright with. I'm not sure if it's imposter syndrome which is keeping me back but I feel like I still need a good wee bit of help. 

I remember though when looking at some websites that I thought to myself and went "I could make some of these sites." For a brief moment, I was happy about that but then I remember thinking this was the problem. Most of these sites are boring and it's going to take more love and care, ultimately skill, to build websites which people actually want to come to. 

I'm going to keep looking at esports websites and generally just many of websites and look at how they function. I'm not talking Imgur or insurances websites with crazy forms. I'm talking sites that people like to go to and learn, what makes them work and if I can build sites like that. The feeling keeps coming back that maybe I should make something that I want to do and go for it. We'll see. I thought that was ColdboltSEO but unfortunately I was incorrect. 

### Other things on my mind

As said, I'm going to put another month to properly get the hang of ReactJS. I understand now that while React itself is pretty awesome, there's so much you can do with it and little of framework. GatsbyJS has earned it's respect with me for how easy it is to build a site. I'm interested in NextJS and it's probably the next thing I'm going to learn. 

I'm well aware that there's a lot that I still have to learn. When it comes to simple JS stuff like comparing two words, programatically, I'm in the shit there. That's going to take a lot of time to really grind my head around how to actually do things programatically and that can only be done with hours of suffering. Like lifting a weight, it's going to take effort. It always takes effort.
