I've updated the website to Gatsby v3! This shouldn't have taken so long but with Gatsby v4 now in beta, I thought it was a good time to learn it there were going to be issues getting this site to v4 for the future, so I worked on updating to v3. I believe I tried to update the site before to v3 but there were issues. I'm not too sure where there weren't issues this time, but it wasn't hard to get things sorted. 

### Gatsby-image-plugin

This was the only real thing I had to sort out for the website. I was using the old gatsby-image plugin which uses fragments in graphql. That's not been removed for an easier API and while it was a little daunting to change, I had already learnt how to use it via coldboltseo.com, which one day I'll update. Thankfully most of the work had already been done via the initial setup of graphql. All I had to do was locate childImageSharp.gatsbyImageData, setup some parameters and then we were good.

### Was there much more than that

There wasn't much more to get sorted. I had to update all the gatsby plugins. I took a chance and updated them all. Installed a npm package which allowed all the packages to be updated to the latest versions and then I took the chance. I updated all the packages and thankfully, everything worked. Phew. This version of the website is a copy though so had anything went wrong, I still had the original version of the site so I wasn't too worried. Still I was happy that everything worked. GGWP.

#### What to do next?

I'm not too sure. I want to add a Twitter thing where I can throw smell thoughts to the site so I can have a look at them in the future. The small thoughts will be a lot easier for me to go through in the future. I'd rather have this gated to a login system so that's something I have no idea to do so I'll have to learn how to add a login system for Gatsby. I still need to get my health sorted first. As I type this, it's 15:00 in the afternoon and I feel tired, after getting eight hours sleep. I don't want to be the type of person that needs 9 hours sleep so I'll be looking to ways to get this sorted. I'll put a lot of effort into this.
