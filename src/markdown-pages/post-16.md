It's occured to me the strategy I was using for ColdboltSEO wasn't something that I was happy with. I like to complain about things which I think is right and hope is right. In some case, I want to believe I'm right because I have an interest for myself to be right. In this case, I believe SEO is useful and it should be taken seriously in esports. Unfortunately esports don't really know how to make use of their websites nor really look like they have an interest to make it work. 

I was thinking about how to approach esports teams needing to have interest and then going about it to a business approach. I got stuck in the thinking SEO wasn't interesting to them because they're interested in their merch sales. That was a bit dumb. No idea why I got stuck with that. So it's come to a point that I know esports teams want to sell things. I went to another rout where I thought SEO wouldn't matter because esports teams would use social media to get the people onto the site. That proved dumb as people want to be able to buy on demand. In the same time, if you have someone on a site, you want them to buy. If the user isn't on the site, they simply won't. 

It's come to the point that it's now fairly obvious to me that there is a demand for esports teams to want to make sure they can sell things on their site but they have issues with making this possible. G2 is a great example of a esports team which have no idea how to make a site for themselves. I'm quite tempted to make a site for them just for the craic and see what happens. 

I've got a notepad worth of ideas to which I want to start making content for. I have a couple of hours tonight so after I lift "I'm currently benching 65Kg without including the bar, another 20Kg!" I'll start planning my first post. Should be good craic. One year since I posted something interesting.
