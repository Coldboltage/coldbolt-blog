I did see myself programming at night whenever dreaming about myself becoming better and better at all things, programming. Mindlessly coding throughout the night, thinking of new things to program and build on dreams. I've now come to know that a lot of the things I wishes I could program, demand people to be involved. HLTV clone? Need people to write. That's actually the only thing I could think of. LoL. 

### Getting back into fitness

This was actually pretty lol. I don't remember how the converation started off, but it ended up myself talking about fitness after watching The Last Samurai (2003). Someone, the notion that I couldn't bench 40Kg plates with a 20Kg bar, was far-fetched. I should probably say this conversation was happening at about 11pm and spanned until 1am at Wednesday Night. I ended up having to do press-ups on Discord stream to a bit of laughter. Honestly, that was some good craic and I was surprised by Jonny's form. Was very solid. Anyway, today I started doing my Ivysaur workout again and boi was I tired. A lot will have to do with recovery and that's something that I have to look at. It'll be something I write about during the day.
