Not sure if this will break the site but I'm going to try to document the work I do to myself and that includes making myself into a better person. I'm not too sure how long I'll record myself doing this, but if I can write this out in 5 mins, then I should be all good to write this. 

#### Benchpress
The last time I was doing bench presses, I felt a lot weaker and it's resulted to push me to take a break for a while. I don't think 14 weeks is solid but taking care of my father has given myself a lot of time to rest. I was able to do the bench presses fine. It could have been better but ultimately, it wasn't too difficult. I want to progress in this fashion however I know by working out, I'll have hard times ahead. 

#### Squat
Hard as ever. My legs aren't at that strong but I was able to push it out. I'll be keeping to this weight for a while as I need to improve my back strength. This is something I'm going to work lightly on via rest days. Tuesday and Thursdays are my active rest days, which I'll take it easy with. 

#### OHP
Not so hard as I remember. My form is a little better so I'm going to push with it. Doing back exercises at the house will help me a lot. When I'm back at the house, I'll put the cables for the door infront of the heating room, so the doors don't pull off. It'll help with getting my back in shape and be some light exercises before coming back. 

#### Conclusion
A nice day of working out. It didn't feel too bad but it also felt pretty hard. Chris and I got some good KFC so that was good craic.
