One of the things I underestimate about coding is making sure you do it each day. I believe I haven't actually added anything to this website for the last three weeks and it's proof that I need to manage my time more effectively. The only way I can do this, is by making myself into a proper manager. Monday and Tuesday are my workdays and I need to get through them. Wednesday to Sunday, that's my days where I can do anything that I want. 

Within those days, my priority has to be my programming. We all need eight hours of sleep or something like that, I'm going to try seven and then instant wake ups. That gives me 17 hours a day. We'll assume one for general maintenance around the house. 16 hours. About four/six hours of programming a day sounds about right. That leaves me around 10 hours of managing or whatever I want time. This is a lot of time that I can work with and it's more about planning my days in advance to find out what I need to do to make sure everything works out. Managing should be done in the time when people are awake. If I were to wake up at 08:00 and start studying by 09:00, that would have me ready to do something by 12:00. I don't like that I want to have everything done by 12:00. This assumes I wake up for 06:00 and start for 07:00? I guess that could be done. 

I can go into bed for 22:00 and attempt to sleep for 23:00. Wake up at 06:00 to then start anything I want at 07:00. This seems like it's going to be a bit difficult but in the same time, it's something that I probably need to do. I'm going to miss out on some matches but in the same time, I don't think I need to watch every single League of Legends match to be excited and in the end of the day, Vods exist. Interesting.
