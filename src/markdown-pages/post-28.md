We be added cateogories onto the site to be able to find out if this crazy stuff works. 

Well it does work so that was pretty simple. I guess what I want to do is find a way to make it that when there is new categories, that I don't have to keep adding new categories to generate new pagination pages all the time. I can add the pages alright but the pagination is very annoying to keep adding. Then again I an get away with it for now so I'm going to do things the easy way for now. I can see issues with this though in the future.
