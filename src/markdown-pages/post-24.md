Like a house and all the work you have to put into keeping it up, the same exists with this website. I'm not too sure why this is the case but it's helping get my confidence back about programming.

I get why people keep telling me to program. Watching the React course has helped me greatly understand more about React. Reducers, rendering, context, it's all in the head now. I'll probably use them in this site next for my next lab project! But you forget things if you don't apply the knowledge you already have. I'm going to take another two days break from the Udemy course so I can apply what I already know. 

I've added a few things onto the site to make it work more effectively. I'm happy with the changes I've made. I need to get a stronger idea on how to use Grid but that'll only come from making things. What I'll make next as a project, I have no idea but I need to get a new headset sorted, which I already have. It's been bought so I'm happy with that. 

I hear my Dad getting up to see if the lunch is ready. I better have a check what he's doing now! He's getting better though. I'm glad.
