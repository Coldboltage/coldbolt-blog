At last, I might have figured an idea that might might be interesting enough for myself to work on. It doesn't take too much effort while allows for those that write the information for me. In short, I don't have to worry about the manual work. So I've got an idea, at last. It's fairly simple. I seen Wooloo had a website previously for all of his leaks and there there's other leaks. I can already tell there's going to be some issues with out of the world type of rumours. This is a problem that can be coded and some sort of algo would be able to be made to determine if the user is getting more rumours correct or not.

### Roster.lol

What the site should be, is all things rosters for League of Legends. It should talk about new rosters as fast as possible and have news connected to it. That seems more then possible. All that I would have to do, is get a list of every single journalist and rumour account on Twitter and follow that. Of course as soon as the news is made, I have about five minutes to get the site updated and then start updating each site as their news comes out. That doesn't seem hard but it's something that needs to be coded first properly. 

GatsbyJS seems a pretty good idea to this. As there's little customisation needed, I can either go with normal static rendering or deferred static generation. I'm fairly sure I can get away with static generation but if the site gets too big, then I can apply DSG to the site. 

### Key pointers for the site

* **Name**: Roster.lol
* **Purpose**: To follow roster news for League of Legends
* **USP**: Will follow the scoops and have it in on place.
* **Additional**: Posts from other websites will be shown. This allows users to start learning the difference of each outlet.
* **Design**: BBC or CBS homepage

I'll start getting something sorted out for the next week. From what I can tell, this shouldn't be too difficult but it's more the workflows which will have to be looked at. I'll make something on this site to be able to identify what they are but this should be good. It'll force myself to build something I want. I'll be able to make a site which is instant and fast. There's a lot of ideas right now floating in my head but I need to make sure the most important things are sorted first. The core.
