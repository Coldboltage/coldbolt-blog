title: "Creating my first real component"
---

I've decided that if I want to make this site operate better, I better start optimising it correctly. I also want to actually learn from what I've been listening to so it's pointless to negate for easiser options. I'll be making my first component which grabs all the posts I've made, including this one. From there, I'll make a component called <PostList> instead of making a {function}. That way, the code will be a lot more tidy and I'll start commenting the code for myself in the future. 

I predict this is going to be hard enough for me but I'm sure with enough effort, I can figure this one out. I'll have to make sure I know how to revert what I do wrong so I'll comment the code for now and then if it works, that'll be it sorted I guess
