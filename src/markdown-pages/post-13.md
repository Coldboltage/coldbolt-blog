I have finally figured out how to source from WordPress. This has been something that I've wanted to do for a very long time and today, when I got out of bed, I decided to give it a shot. It wasn't as hard as I thought initially. Infact it was a lot easier. All it required was for a plugin to be added to ColdboltSEO and then to configure a plugin on this blog. That wasn't hard. It might have taken a minute or two. To be honest, I just gave it a shot and fuck it worked.

Thankfully I decided to download materialize and a lot of the styling has worked out really well. I couldn't be bothered styling with crap. I just want something that works and thankfully materialize has helped with this process a lot. I've got great styling and it looks solid. Images could look a bit better which I might look into in the future. MDX is probably something I should explore next. I did it in the Udemy course but it was such a big topic, I have to look into this in the future.

ColdboltSEO will be the next site I have to work on. I'm not sure how I'm going to design ColdboltSEO but I think I'm going to find a fairly good HTML page and then start importing what I need into it. I'm honestly not sure how this is going to work at all. We'll see.
