I can't actually remember what I did but I do remember adding darkmode. I think I added a couple of other things but really I'm not too sure what I did xD. Oh well I got dark mode working on local development but I couldn't get it working properly on Netlify. I'm not too sure how to sort this because well, I'm still improving and learning. I'm going to take it easy with the dark mode. 

LocalStorage is operating weird but it was good to get used to operating that again and then making sure that state would work well. Though other things look more effective on the site, this felt good to get working properly. With some styling additions, working with the Consumer and Provider in the same time, I do hate that I can't use, useContext properly and it's something I'll have to learn more and more. 

I learnt a lot with this and I'll figure out how to get darkmode working properly. I'm not too sure if it has something to do with localStorage but for now, I'll keep the darkmode as it is and work on other things for now.
