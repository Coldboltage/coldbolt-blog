I found the image on Facebook and it was worth getting a copy. I'm hoping the person too the photo doesn't mind that I'm using it here. It's certainly copyright violation but oh well. It's a good photo. 

The programming stuff here, I think I'm annoyed that I can't do basic styling which I'm going to use CSS and Flex as a means to get full control over. This shouldn't take too long. I'm happy with the progress that I've made with React. It's stuff that I understand and I won't be forgetting. I'll probably return to the bigger projects sometime this week however my annoyance is the inability out of pure will, to make UI's that I want for projects on this site. It shouldn't be so hard so I'll be following quite a lot of guides today to get to the point of confidence. I'm happy with this decision I'm making. 

#### UKLC Relegations are heating up

As I write this, I want to keep working on other things instead of getting one thing done. That's going to take willpower to overcome like a many of other things. For now, Nox look like they have a strong enough roster. I'm not sure of the situation of Lucent but if they want to make a change, it'll probably be with their midlane. Nox have made changes to their mid and support, certainly their weakest points of the team. The managers seem a lot more ruthless, something that I don't completely agree with but it's something to make sure the other three players need to have. Someone willing to steer the ship. Adding Tziz is a good add but fastlegged, probably a good add but not enough for Hasse. Thankfully we have data with Kazz with-held so that'll be good. I'm excited about UKLC Relegations but I don't know if they org will want to keep me on if I fail. We'll see. I'm certainly getting better as a manager and I know I'm progressing. It feels like the experience is certainly helping me out. Now it's just the politics which I need to work on. 

#### My father

He's getting better. Not so great today when it comes to stress but he's getting better. I don't see myself leaving in the next month. He needs too much care randomly and I'm sure I'd keep worrying that something hasn't work out correctly. Thinking about it now, I'm not too sure I was able to settle it in my mind before my father went to hospital. He's in the same state of not being too good now than he was there. That wasn't on from me but he's got me to take care of him now. That's good. I'm sure he'll get better. Let's hope for the best. 

#### Thinking of ideas

For me to think of ideas, I need to put time to look at things and put my ideas into paper. I'm seeing issues with cosplayers fearing Instagram and Pateron. It's kinda weird this is a thing. People shouldn't have to fear the platform they are on but in the same time, you can tell that cosplayers go out of their way to prevent themselves of getting censored or worse, banned. Then we have issues when it comes to news sites making themselves as SEO ready as they can. I used to really like playing League but recently, it's very hard to get to know new people which I think is a bit of a problem. Also IRL friends had a lot of interest but that never stopped me playing CoD. Then again, that was the only thing that I did. learning takes a lot of time but I think it allows me to have a life where playing lol might be interesting. Maybe I need to find out if LoL is worth having in my life. I enjoy the game but I don't play it enough. It takes a lot of time to keep on the ball with the game. It's nowhere near as fun to play on your own. Maybe it wouldn't be a bad idea to get to know more managers to play with each other. That sounds like a dead on idea. I need to get along with more people though and get a better idea of the scene. Better planning days will probably help.
