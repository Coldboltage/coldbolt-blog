I'm kind of annoyed that it's taken me this long to get to the point of making this post but I've done it. Pagination has been added to the website and it should never have taken so long to add it to the website. It looked scary to add it but I've come to the point to think, fuck it. It can't be that bad. Guess what. What wasn't.

At least with this add, I have grown to learn that I've still got a long way to learn about all things Gatsby and programming. There's still a long way to go for me but I wanted to say that at least.
